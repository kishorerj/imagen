"Cropping Guidelines": "Crop images below the chest and above the knees for balanced symmetry. Avoid close-ups of the face and cropping at the feet. Maintain overall symmetry in the image.",
"Composition Requirements": "Position the main subject in the center for balanced visuals. Align elements horizontally and vertically for balance, stability, and emphasis on height. Use symmetrical arrangements for harmony. Employ diagonal lines for dynamic visuals. Use lines to guide the viewer's eye naturally.",
"Basic Rules - Layout": "Ensure the image subject doesn't overlap with UI elements like the clock. Maintain a gap of a few pixels between the clock and the subject. Avoid images with white or bright backgrounds that obscure the clock. Key visuals should be within the designated safe area and not overlap with top or bottom UI elements. Avoid placing the image focus in the main UI area (headline, CTA, summary).",
"Image Editing": "Use content-aware or manual fill to remove patches. Clean the background to remove dust and unwanted objects. Remove unwanted tint and adjust color temperature for a natural look. Restore skin tones and fine-tune brightness, contrast, and saturation for balanced and vibrant visuals.",
"Image Quality": "Reduce grain and noise while retaining clarity. Apply slight sharpening for better details."
